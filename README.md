# EDA on US accidents from 2016 to 2021 (Over 2.5 million records)

## Introduction
In this project I attempted to gain meaningful insights from a huge list of features present in data set. Dataset contains accident records from US cities that span across nationwide from year 2016 to 2021


## Data Preparation and Cleaning 
    Operations attempted in this section:-
     -Load file using Pandas:
        *  Imported required libraries like pandas,
            opendatsets

        *  Used Kaggle API to download dataset 
           directly   to google colab.

     -Look at information about data and its columns

        * Checked basic information abut my dataset,
          eg. number of records,shape,stats. 

     -Fix any missing or incorrect values
        *  Checked for missing values present in my
           dataset  

## Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Performed indepth analysis on cities feature, to
      check most affected cities by accidents.

    * Visualised which hour, day of the week and month
      witnesses most number of accidents 

    * Analyzed if having bump can increase the chances 
      of accidents.

    * Analyzed if rounabout is a factor contributing 
      to accidents

    * Further compared severity of accident and 
      visibility and their combination causing an
      increased number of accidents or not?

      
## Questions
Added a list of questions to my notebook that i developed while performing EDA, and answered each of them with help of clean and simple visualisations in the notebook itself
## Summary and Conclusion
This section contains list of insights that I obtained while answering all the questions i developed while performing EDA.
